==========================
Lightning Navigation
==========================

Just some example code that will return all or specific sections from a lighting publication.

==========================
Usage:
==========================

The default return is an object of pre-defined sections (check includes/config.csp):
<dti:file:include base="site" file="/PATH/FROM/SITES/FOLDER/TO/navigation.csp?publication=web" />

Specify "&mode=all" to get all sections:
<dti:file:include base="site" file="/PATH/FROM/SITES/FOLDER/TO/navigation/navigation.csp?publication=web&mode=all" />

You can also use a regular CSP include:<csp:include page="/ROOT/RELATIVE/PATH/TO/navigation/navigation.csp?publication=web">

Note: You can also access navigation.csp directly via you browser. In other words, this code will work outside of a Lightning publication. :)

==========================
Notes:
==========================

For prime-time code usage, I would probably remove the check for "mode" in the navigation.csp loop starting at line 119... I threw-in a "mode" check for the sake of example only. If it were me, I would go with the config file approach and maintain a list of allowed sections.

* I quickly slapped this code together (basically) from scratch, so use at your own risk.
* Always test code on your testing server!
